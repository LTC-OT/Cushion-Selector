1. Comfort: Whether you’re going to sit on this cushion for a few hours or all day long, it needs to be comfortable

2. Stability: A stable cushion helps you balance without sliding and makes it easier when you’re reaching or doing other movements while in your chair

3. Skin Protection: Cushions that offer pressure relief and reduce friction can help prevent painful pressure sores

4. Microclimate: The temperature and moisture of your body against the seat affect skin breakdown. You want a cool seat with good airflow

5. Cushion Weight: Heavier cushions offer more comfort but add weight that could affect self-propulsion in a lightweight wheelchair. Consider what makes the most sense for your needs

6. Cushion Height: A taller cushion could make it easier to reach counter surfaces, but it might mean your chair doesn’t fit under a table or desk. Make sure the height still allows you to transfer too

7. Maintenance: Some cushions require maintenance with each use (like air cushions that need to be checked for leaks) while others are low maintenance (like honeycomb cushions)

8. Price: Does the cushion fit your budget? Think about how long each type lasts on average and the features it offers to make an informed decision

    There are several types of cushion mediums available which all offer various levels of pressure relief or redistribution.
    Foam (flexible polyurethane)
    
    • Foam products are manufactured with variations in
    • Density – defined as mass of foam per unit volume and varies from low to high.
    
    Higher density allows more thickness and depth and so gives more support.
    It also retains its support properties for a longer period of time
    
    • Firmness – soft to hard. These may be used in combination where closer to the sitting surface the foam is soft to enhance comfort and body conformation whilst the base is harder to maintain shape and integrity of the cushion
    
    • Can be cut to various shapes and sizes according to individual requirements
    • Compresses with body weight over time and requires regular replacement eg every 12 months when used daily
    • Permeable to moisture unless has specific seal or coating eg neoprene
    • Foam with varying properties can also be used in custom design cushions which are utilised by specialist seating clinics
    Latex rubber
    • Tends to keep its shape better than some foam and is more durable
    • Can be cut to measure in different sizes and heights
    
    Fluid
    
    • Fluid is described as different to water as has a higher viscosity yet weighs less than water
    • Fluid can be manufactured with various components but tends to be of a consistency (viscosity) with no memory ie shape doesn’t return after weight is removed
    • Fluid conforms and moves with the body
    • Fluid can be distributed into compartments where pressure relief needs are higher
    • May need to be kneaded back into shape on a regular basis
    • If the seal is damaged the fluid will leak and should not continue to be used
    
    Gel
    
    • Tends to have slow memory
    • Can be self-sealing if the seal is broken
    • Gel conforms to bony prominences and moves with the body
    • Can feel cold in winter months
    
    Air
    
    • In an optimal situation provides significant pressure redistribution
    • Tends to be more unstable for the client
    • Does not provide superior pelvic positioning control
    • If seal is lost, air can leak quickly and the cushion becomes flat
    • Requires regular monitoring to maintain optimal air inflation
    • Air inflation can be altered by temperature changes
    • Air inflation and cushion pressure is altered by altitude eg during air travel
    • There are alternating air cushions with pumps available
    
    Water
    
    • Heavy compared to other mediums
    • Can be unstable for the user
    • If seal is lost will leak quickly
    Can feel cold in winter months
    
    Combinations
    
    • Many products offer a combination of mediums to achieve stability, durability and pressure redistribution. These combinations can be foam/fluid, foam/gel, foam/air etc
    Specialised computerised or moulding products
    • Tend to be very expensive and are often used only by specialist clinics

Most often, seat and back cushions are classified according to their shape and constituent material. From the standpoint of materials, cushions can be divided into three categories:

Foam Cushions;
Fluid-filled Cushions (Air, Water, Elastomer Gels and Viscous Liquids);
Hybrid Models,

These cushions can be static or dynamic. Fluid-filled and foam cushions are static devices designed to even out or distribute pressure on the pelvic contact surface.

Dynamic cushion models are based on the principle that high local pressure can be tolerated as long as the duration of contact does not exceed certain pre-established limits.

A few applications of this principal have been attempted. For example, there is, in essence, a mechanical model and a model consisting of bellows-type air cells.

It will help to reduce pressure. Anyone at risk of developing a pressure sore should be given a pressure relief cushion. There are different types of pressure relief cushions. Pressure relief cushions help to reduce pressure by:

Distributing a wheelchair user’s weight as evenly as possible across the seat surface;

Reducing pressure under high-pressure risk areas e.g. seat bones, hip bones, coccyx/tail bone;

Reducing shear by assisting the wheelchair user to sit upright.

Foam Contoured Pressure Relief Cushions

Base Layer

The base of a pressure relief cushion should provide a Firm Stable Base.
This will ensure the cushion provides good support for the user and does not move when the user moves.

Top Layer

Over the base layer there should be a “comfort layer”. This is a layer (or more than one layer) of softer foam.

The top layer should be soft enough to allow the seat bones to sink into it, but should not be so soft that the seat bones can sink all the way to the bottom and rest on the solid base or seat of the wheelchair.

A “well” under the seat bones to reduce pressure;

Support under the hip bones to help distribute weight;

        title: "Cushion Covers",
        definition: """
A pressure relief cushion should have a cover which can be removed for washing and is water-resistant. The material used for a pressure relief cushion cover should be either stretchy or loose enough to allow the seat bones to sink into the foam.

If the cover fabric is not stretchy, a thin fabric is best. Folds in a thin fabric will be less likely to mark the skin and cause a pressure sore.

If thin plastic is used under a fabric cover, this also needs to be loose enough to allow the seat bones to sink into the foam.

Always advise wheelchair users that if their cushion or cushion cover becomes wet it needs to be dried and replaced only when dry. For wheelchair users who are incontinent and at risk of developing a pressure sore, provide two cushions which may be used in turn.

Wherever possible, wheelchair users who are incontinent need a cushion cover which is water-resistant and will keep fluid away from the user’s skin.

If there is no water-resistant cover: Investigate what assistance can be provided to reduce incontinence; Provide a second cushion, so that one can be drying while the user sits on the other;

Protect the cushion with a very thin plastic bag inside the cover. If using a plastic bag: Check that the plastic bag does not cause the user to “slide” on the cushion; Make sure that there are no creases in the plastic bag that could cause a pressure sore;

The wheelchair user must ensure that fluid does not “pool” over the plastic, as this increases the risk of a pressure sore; The wheelchair user should ensure that the cover is dried out if it becomes wet and the plastic bag cleaned or replaced.
When choosing the type of cushion cover consider:
• Should always use recommended cover for the type and model of cushion
• Should use no other object as interface between cushion, cover and client ie sheepskins, blueys
etc
• Non-skid bases to maintain cushion position on the wheelchair eg during transfers
• Air exchange in tropical climates
• Promoting ease of handling of cushion eg fabric handles for carrying

    What Is It?
    
    In a posterior pelvic tilt, the top of the pelvis is tipped rearward. This rotational movement of the pelvis results in a flexed or kyphotic trunk.
    Correcting a posterior pelvic tilt with a neutral alignment of the pelvis will:
        •    Support the anatomical curvature of the spine
        •    Promote weight bearing on the ischial tuberosities (ITs) to reduce pressure risk
        •    Provide optimal alignment for anatomical function
        •    Increase proximal stability for function
    
    What Causes It?
    
        •    Low tone in the trunk
        •    Tight hamstrings
        •    Tight hip flexors
        •    Overlong seat depth
        •    The client sliding forward or actively extending on the seat
    
    How Should I Solve It?
    
    Adequate posterior support to the pelvis will prevent the rearward movement that results in posterior pelvic tilt. One option is a biangular back, which keeps the pelvis in an upright, neutral tilt while also allowing the trunk to extend beyond the pelvis.
    If the problem is tight hamstrings, you can alleviate the pull on the muscle by either opening the seat-to-back angle or decreasing the angle of the upper leg to the lower leg.
    When limited hip flexion is the issue, flexing the hip pushes the pelvis into a posterior tilt. This can be solved by opening the seat-to-back angle.
    If your client is sliding and extending, you can employ two solutions in tandem. First, an anti-thrust cushion creates a curb in front of the ITs to prevent the client from slipping forward. Next, placing a pelvic positioning belt at a 60-degree angle to the client (rather than the more typical 45-degree angle) will also prevent this forward movement.

        •    Reduce the accompanying lordosis
        •    Achieve neutral alignment of the pelvis for weight bearing on the ITs

    Pelvic rotation occurs when one ASIS is more forward than the other.

        •    Support the anatomical curvatures of the spine
        •    Promote weight bearing on the ITs

        •    Prevent trunk rotation
        •    Increase pressure distribution over the posterior trunk
    
    What Causes It?
    
        •    Range-of-motion limitations in the hips, including abduction, adduction, and flexion
        •    A leg-length discrepancy that has not been addressed in the seating system
        •    Hip dislocation, rather than an actual difference in femur length
        •    Discomfort that causes the client to rotate the pelvis in an effort to alleviate the pain
        •    Tone and reflex activity such as asymmetrical tonic neck reflex (ATNR) that pulls the pelvis into rotation
    
    How Should I Solve It?
    
    If the client’s range of motion is limited, placing the lower extremities directly in front of the client may result in pulling the pelvis into rotation. Instead, place the legs in an asymmetrical posture, often known as a windswept posture, to allow the pelvis to remain neutral.
    You can accommodate a leg-length discrepancy with an asymmetrical seat depth. When pain is the culprit, work closely with your client’s medical team to identify the source of the pain and solve it, if possible. If increased tone or reflexes are contributing to pelvic rotation, increasing flexion and abduction may “break up” the tone.
    An anti-thrust seat can also be helpful since this blocks the motion of the IT that tends to move forward.

    Terminology (
        image: "pelvic obliquity",
        title: "Pelvic Obliquity",
        definition: """
    What Is It?
    
    Pelvic obliquity is when one side of the pelvis is higher than the other, resulting in a lateral curvature of the spine. One common consequence of pelvic obliquity is pressure ulcers located under an IT.
    Correcting a flexible obliquity or accommodating a fixed obliquity provides the best alignment for biomechanical function so you can:
        •    Level the head
        •    Level the pelvis
        •    Equalize pressure under the pelvis at the ITs
    What Causes It?
        •    Lateral sclerosis
        •    Hip surgeries
        •    Discomfort, since the client may assume an obliquity in an attempt to shift their weight off of a painful hip
    
    How Should I Solve It?
    
    The other primary intervention for obliquity is wedging. If the obliquity is flexible, a wedge is placed under the seat on the low side to level the pelvis. In a fixed obliquity, a wedge is placed under the seat on the high side to better distribute pressure between the ITs. A pressure map will help determine if the pressure is well-distributed.
    After wedging a fixed obliquity, the client may be unable to laterally balance their head, depending on the amount of lateral scoliosis. In this case, a lateral tilt may be required to level the head over the pelvis.
    
    Client comfort is key to their quality of life. By knowing how to identify these issues and their causes and quickly addressing them, you can help your clients sit comfortably while supporting their anatomy and reducing the risk of complications like pressure ulcers.
    
    The right solution depends on whether your obliquity is correctable or fixed. A correctable obliquity allows the pelvis to be repositioned properly. If the obliquity is in the early stages, an adjustable quadrant cushion can help.. Secure it at a 90 degree angle to counteract the obliquity. If you’re looking for one simple solution, a no lean cushion can be used with both correctable and fixed conditions. Place the built-up side under the lower half of your pelvis if it’s correctable. This will help keep your pelvis equal and balanced. If you have fixed obliquity, place the built-up side under the higher half. This will reduce pressure and give you more stability than a flat cushion.

    Cushion Width
    
    It is often assumed that the cushion width should be the same as the width of the wheelchair.
    Although dependent on the type and model of cushion being prescribed, the width of the cushion should be determined by the width of the client. Make sure you check with the manufacturer regarding method of measurement.
    
    Measure the client sitting in the wheelchair. If unable to do this, measure in supine with hips and knees at right angles. Taking into account that there may be extra soft tissue around the hip area, measure the distance between bony greater trochanters. This is a particularly important measurement where the cushion design relies on supporting the greater trochanters to allow immersion of the ischial tuberosities. Some cushions require measurements between the ASIS.
    
    Cushion Depth
    
    In order to maximise the seating surface ie spread the weight over as large an area as possible, the cushion should come to 2 to 3 fingerbreadths from the back of the knee. In order to achieve this measurement, you will need to measure from behind the hip to the back of the knee, then subtract the
    2 or 3 fingerbreadths. This measurement can be done in side lying with hips flexed to 90 degrees or in sitting.
    
    When determining this measurement, you also need to take into account the front frame angle of the wheelchair. This is the angle of the frame to the footplate. The greater this angle, the more the feet will be tucked back and possibly the shorter the seat depth required.
    
    Also consider the type and design of the back upholstery or whether a solid back support is used. You need to determine whether the back support will be positioned in front or behind the wheelchair canes. This can affect the depth of the seat and where the client is positioned on the cushion. If a client has a leg length discrepancy, consider the accommodation of this eg cutting one side of the cushion at the front.
    
    A cushion can extend 3 to 4cms past the seat depth of the wheelchair. This can be achieved by using a solid seat under the cushion for support. Some cushion bases are sturdier than others. This feature will minimise the problem of having a wheelchair that is too long and therefore less manoeuvrable due to the size of the turning circle.
    
    Cushion Height
    
    The height of the cushion will be affected by the type and model of the cushion, the amount of contouring required in the cushion to control leg positioning and the amount of pressure redistribution required.
    
    The height of the cushion will impact on several functional and propulsion issues:
    • Client centre of gravity and height from the floor may affect balance
    • The relative height of the backrest may not give adequate support
    • Access to reaching the wheels for propulsion
    • Access to reach the wheelchair brakes
    • Height with respect to transfers
    • Access under desks
    • Relevant position of the footplate to provide adequate thigh support
    If you are encouraging a client who has never used a cushion to add one to their wheelchair, the use of a drop down seat may assist in minimising the effect of a change in thickness and seat height.
