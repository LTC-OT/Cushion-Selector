The Geo-Matrix Gold cushion is often used in long-term care where frequent cleaning is required.

The Gold cushion provides maximum pressure redistribution for people with high risk of skin breakdown and/or existing wounds; limited mobility and/or postural control; and people who are incapable of re-positioning themselves.

Two layers of 1 high Blue gel and one layer of 1 high Green gel.

Meticulously engineered wheelchair cushions that do not require calibration with no risk of punctures or leaks. Optimal comfort skin
protection function and durability. For use at home in hospitals and long-term care.

Our Geo-Matrix seating system offers people the ability to sit longer without discomfort. The innovative gel and gel/foam layers effectively
manage pressure with enhanced immersion qualities.

Blood flow is increased and peak pressure points are minimized because Geo-Matrix gel columns share the pressure load from bony prominences
which increases the footprint and inherently decreases pressure. This stimulates wound healing and reduces the risk of pain-related problems
and skin breakdown.

The innovative Geo-Matrix seating systems also provide these unique benefits:

Gel layers and covers that can easily be disinfected and even machine-washed

Proven pressure redistribution to prevent skin breakdown and heal existing pressure ulcers

Worry-free comfort no risk of punctures flattening failing or inflation issues

Temperature-proof Geo-Matrix gel does not harden in cold or capture/retain heat

The dry-polymer closed-cell construction ensures no risk of the migration leaking or oozing hazards posed by air- or fluid-filled products

Gels vibration dampening qualities absorb vibration reducing associated fatigue.

        components: """
Axiom SP Fluid takes advantage of the Axiom Difference and is designed to provide increased immersion and envelopment using a Hydrolite fluid
bladder instead of the Viscoelastic Foam used in the Axiom SP Visco.

Hydrolite Fluid Bladder

Hydrolite is a non-Newtonian fluid that behaves as a solid under the force of gravity but flows as a viscous fluid under load which can help
minimize shear. It is also incredibly light eliminating the "weight penalty" of other fluid cushions. It is also non-temperature sensitive
meaning it will provide consistent performance regardless of climate.

The Axiom SP Fluid uses a Hydrolite fluid bladder instead of Viscoelastic Foam. The bladder rests directly under the super stretch outer cover
allowing it to conform to the tissues supporting the Ischial Tuberosities.

Increased Envelopment

Axiom SP Fluid is designed to provide increased envelopment allowing the trochanters to bear an effective load. This improves stability by
widening the base of support and reduces the load the tissue that supports the Ischial Tuberosities must bear.

High-Quality Foam Materials

Axiom SP Fluid is constructed with foam that has a high IFD and density. The dual density polyurethane foam base offers firm support in the
lower layer with a durable comfort layer on top. High-quality materials lead to a long-lasting comfortable and high-performing product.

Surface Tension Reduction

The Hydrolite fluid bladder sits on top of the waterproof inner cover; reducing surface tension and maximizing envelopment of the ischia and
coccyx. The bladder rests directly under the super stretch outer cover allowing it to conform to the tissues supporting the Ischial
Tuberosities. By using the super 4-way stretch Lycra outer cover material surface tension is reduced providing better immersion into the well.

Pre-Contoured Shape

It's important for all cushions to have a properly designed pre-contoured shape. That's why we cooperated with Georgia Tech to study
anthropometrics. Axiom SP Fluid has a properly designed pre-contoured shape. Axiom SP Fluid is designed to provide increased immersion
allowing the trochanters to bear an effective load widening the base of support and reducing the load the Ischial Tuberosities must bear.

Axiom SP Fluid has an innovative cover that is aesthetically pleasing with functional benefits for both the client and caregiver. The super
4-way stretch Lycra outer cover reduces surface tension while the pleated 4-way stretch inner cover with self-sealing zipper is water
resistant and is easy to clean.

The water-resistant zipper and loop zipper pull make it simple to don and doff the cover while protecting the
foam. There is an easy-to-reach front handle with utility loops for hanging accessories

Axiom SP Visco takes advantage of the Axiom Difference and is designed to provide increased immersion using a Viscoelastic Foam instead of the

Hydrolite fluid bladder seen in the Axiom SP Fluid.

Viscoelastic Material

Viscoelastic material is both viscous (changes shape slowly) and elastic (it returns to its original shape). It deforms and returns to shape
very slowly. There is a significant lag between when you deform viscoelastic foam and when it returns to shape. Because energy is effectively
absorbed and dissipated during the time lag there is less reaction force pushing back after deformation.

Increased Immersion

Axiom SP Visco is designed to provide increased immersion allowing the trochanters to bear an effective load. This improves stability by
widening the base of support and reduces the load the tissue that supports the Ischial Tuberosity must bear. A thick section of specially
designed Viscoelastic foam deforms to immerse and envelop the Ischial tuberosity.

High-Quality Foam Materials

Axiom SP Visco is constructed with foam that has a high IFD and density. The dual density polyurethane foam base offers firm support in the
lower layer with a durable comfort layer on top. While the viscoelastic foam insert with unique hexagonal shapes increase envelopment and
reduce compression around the ischia and coccyx. High-quality foam materials lead to a long-lasting comfortable and high-performing product.

Surface Tension Reduction

The viscoelastic foam insert with unique hexagonal shapes increase envelopment and reduce compression around the ischia and coccyx. The outer
cover features a microclimatic spacer fabric layer with horseshoe design around the well for layer reduction allowing the foam insert to rest
directly beneath the pleated 4-way stretch Lycra cover to reduce surface tension.

Pre-Contoured Shape

It's important for all cushions to have a properly designed pre-contoured shape. That's why we cooperated with Georgia Tech to study
anthropometrics. Axiom SP Visco has a properly designed pre-contoured shape designed to provide increased immersion allowing the trochanters
to bear an effective load widening the base of support and reducing the load the Ischial Tuberosities must bear. The well also has two small
areas where foam is removed under the Ischial Tuberosities to facilitate immersion.

Feature Rich Cover

Axiom SP Visco has an innovative cover that is aesthetically pleasing with functional benefits for both the client and caregiver. The super
4-way stretch Lycra outer cover reduces surface tension while the pleated 4-way stretch inner cover with self-sealing zipper is water
resistant and is easy to clean. The water-resistant zipper and loop zipper pull make it simple to don and doff the cover while protecting the
foam.

The Invacare Matrx Flovair Gentle Contour seat cushion was developed to provide pelvic stability, leg positioning, and pressure management for
patients with postural asymmetry and skin integrity concerns.

It incorporates a fluid overlay used in tandem with the ThinAir liner. This allows for pelvic immersion while minimizing overall product
weight.

The insert's unique channeling method limits the amount of fluid migration, thus decreasing the chances for "bottoming out." The Flovair is a
great choice for neuromuscular, TBI, or SCI clients without significant obliquity.

Positioning Foam Base: Supports the pelvis and thighs; helps to prevent adduction and internal rotation. Fluid + ThinAir liner: Effectively
redistributes pressure without the penalty of added weight. Additional shear reduction as two layers work in harmony.
