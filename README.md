The Cushion Selection project is designed to assist Occupational Therapy (OT) students working in long-term care facilities. As part of their education, OT students often encounter residents with diverse needs related to skin integrity, posture, and functional mobility. Proper cushion selection plays a crucial role in enhancing comfort, preventing pressure ulcers, and promoting overall well-being.

This project serves as a valuable tool for OT students, providing guidance on selecting the most suitable cushions for individual residents. It combines educational resources, assessment tools, and practical recommendations to ensure optimal cushion choices.
